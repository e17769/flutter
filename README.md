## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

You will find most of the logic in the [tree/main/lib folder] (https://github.com/e17769/myMealFlutterMobileApp/tree/main/lib)
you can create your own new classes `newclass.dart` in that folder, then include it like so `import 'newclass.dart';`
